# **Hair Day Project**  
This repository contains my implementation of the Hair Day project from the [Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer). The project focuses on designing and developing a scalable and responsive **Home Page** for a hair styling service.
